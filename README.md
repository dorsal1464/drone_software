# drone_software
Barebones implementation of wifi comm based drone controlling software. the drone is controlled by a 32bit microcontroller, such as esp32, arduino, etc...

The drone may be set up by any computer with wifi onboard, I'd recommend raspberry pie.
The controller of the drone is a microcontroller that will be connected to the computer via serial port.
Any 32bit microcontroller with a serial port should work, I'd recommend arduino nano.
